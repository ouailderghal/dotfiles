# Packages

List of packages that I have installed on my Arch Linux machine. Packages from the **Official Arch Repository** are listed in 
`packages.txt` file, and packages from **Arch User Repository (AUR)** are listed in `packages-aur.txt` file.

- Install packages from official repository : 

```shell
sudo pacman -S - < packages.txt
```

- Install packages from AUR : 

```shell
yay -S - < packages-aur.txt
```
